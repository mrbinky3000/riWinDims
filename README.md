=========

This jQuery plugin helps developers present website prototypes to peers and clients while providing width and height information useful for debugging.  In addition to the current window dimensions, there is a scan-able QR code, and options to resize the current browser window (See "Behavior" below). The only benefit to this plugin over the various browser scriptlets and plugins that currently exist, is that this script allows clients and colleagues to self explore your prototypes without requiring them to install anything on their computers.
